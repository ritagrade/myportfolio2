intro: |
  Volvo was invited to be sponsor Lisbon of Museum of Art, Architecture and Technology (MAAT) and the Museum of Electricity. The challenge was how to do much more than just a logo on the communication or a decorated car. We believed from the very beginning, that Volvo should have an active brand presence, covering themes such as: Sustainability, Safety, Mobility. “Sustainability” was the choice and from that day a wave started to emerge.
